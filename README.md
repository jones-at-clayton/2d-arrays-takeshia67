# Two-Dimensional Array Practice


Local Girl Scout Troup #87819 wants to analyze las year's cookie sales so they can try to improve sales this year. They have the following data compiled by scout and cookie: 

| |Tagalongs| Trefoils | Thin Mints | Samoas|
|-|---------|----------|------------|-------|
**Jet**|4559.49|8860.30|2291.90|8550.84|
**Dana**|7946.93|9703.66|9924.06|531.69|
**Angela**|5027.48|8050.74|3715.77|9573.72|
**Ayanna**|866.44|2310.67|2749.98|3747.57|
**Denise**|5133.77|1812.53|2690.81|399.51|

## Task

The Troup Leader wants you to create an application that displays some stats for them. 

1. Create a two-dimensional array based on the table given above. Remember that you're only storing the data in the table, not the labels (i.e., just worry about the numbers for this step, not the names).
2. Print the data (just the numbers is fine for now)
3. Calculate and display the total sales (i.e., sum all the values in the table).
4. Calculate and display the total sales for each cookie.

__For full credit, all loops must not hardcode the values for number of rows and columns (i.e., don't type in a number for the test portion of the loop, use the appropriate code to get the number of rows/columns).__

## Extra Challenge
Want to challenge yourself? Try these on for size:
- Calculate and display the average sales per scout
- Store the names of the cookies and the scouts in one-dimensional arrays. Print these when you print the data table.
- Display the total by cookie using the name of the cookie from the one-dimensional array

_Note: I recommend doing the basic part first then trying to add the challenge in._
